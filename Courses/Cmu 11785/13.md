Summary

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which helps in modeling sequences and capturing long-term dependencies in data.

1. RNN Architecture: RNNs are designed to handle sequences by maintaining a hidden state that recurs, allowing the network to utilize information from previous inputs effectively. This architecture is vital for tasks where context and timing matter.

1. Long-term Dependencies: The ability of RNNs to capture long-term dependencies makes them suitable for applications like stock market forecasting and speech recognition, where past information influences future outputs significantly.
1. Memory Units: Architectures like Jordan and Elman networks include memory units, which enable the network to retain information about earlier computations, improving their predictive capabilities.
1. Fully Recurrent Networks: These networks allow the hidden state at each time step to be influenced by previous states, facilitating error propagation across time steps.
1. BPTT Training Method: Backpropagation through time is a training algorithm that adjusts weights by calculating gradients over the entire sequence, making it possible to optimize the networkâ€™s performance on sequential data.

1. Bidirectional Processing: Bidirectional RNNs enhance data analysis by processing inputs in both forward and backward directions, by providing both previous and future data.
